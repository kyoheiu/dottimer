timers are difined as one of two types:
- Monotonic timers
- Realtime timers

The unit file with the same name of the timer will be activated.
like: foo.timere activates foo.service
This can be changed by `Unit=bar.service`

may include Unit and Install sections

Unit
Description=readble title of the unit
Documentation=space separated list of URIs like https://

Install
WantedBy=foo.service

Monotonic Timer
OnActiveSec=Defines a timer relative to the moment the timer unit itself is activated.
OnBootSec=Defines a timer relative to when the machine was booted up. In containers, for the system manager instance, this is mapped to OnStartupSec=, making both equivalent.
OnStartupSec=Defines a timer relative to when the service manager was first started. For system timer units this is very similar to OnBootSec= as the system service manager is generally started very early at boot. It's primarily useful when configured in units running in the per-user service manager, as the user service manager is generally started on first login only, not already during boot.
OnUnitActiveSec=Defines a timer relative to when the unit the timer unit is activating was last activated.
OnUnitInactiveSec=Defines a timer relative to when the unit the timer unit is activating was last deactivated.

Realtime Timer
OnCalender=Defines realtime (i.e. wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions.

Other options
AccuracySec=Specify the accuracy the timer shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min.
RandomizedDelaySec=Delay the timer by a randomly selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0 and the specified time value.
FixedRandomDelay=default to false Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the randomized offset specified by RandomizedDelaySec= is reused for all firings of the same timer.
OnClockChange=, OnTimezoneChange=These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered when the system clock (CLOCK_REALTIME) jumps relative to the monotonic clock (CLOCK_MONOTONIC), or when the local system timezone is modified.
